# Memory Optimization and Performance Tuning

This document describes the memory optimization and performance tuning strategies implemented in the MessagePack AssemblyScript library.

## Buffer Pooling

Buffer pooling is a memory optimization technique that reuses memory buffers instead of allocating new ones for each operation. This reduces memory allocation overhead and garbage collection pressure.

### Implementation

- `BufferPool` class provides a singleton pool for reusing buffers
- Two types of buffers are pooled:
  - `GrowableBuffer` instances for encoding operations
  - `Uint8Array` instances for temporary storage during decoding
- Best-fit algorithm selects the most appropriate buffer from the pool
- Buffers that are too large are not pooled to prevent memory bloat
- Statistics tracking for monitoring pool efficiency

### Usage

```typescript
// Enable buffer pooling (default)
const encoder = new MessagePackEncoder(1024, true);
encoder.encode(value);
encoder.cleanup(); // Important: return buffer to pool

// Create decoder with pooling
const decoder = MessagePackDecoder.withPooling(encodedData);
const value = decoder.decode();
decoder.cleanup(); // Important: clean up temporary buffers
```

## Hot Path Optimizations

Hot paths are code paths that are executed frequently. Optimizing these paths can significantly improve performance.

### Encoder Optimizations

- Fast path for encoding common types (integers, strings, booleans, null)
- Optimized string to UTF-8 conversion with ASCII fast path
- Reduced branching in type dispatch
- Specialized integer encoding for common ranges

### Decoder Optimizations

- Fast path for decoding common types (positive fixint, negative fixint, fixstr)
- Optimized UTF-8 validation with ASCII fast path
- Direct buffer access for better performance
- Reduced memory allocations using buffer pooling

## WebAssembly-Specific Optimizations

These optimizations are specific to WebAssembly and AssemblyScript:

- Proper memory alignment for better performance
- Efficient memory access patterns
- Optimized integer operations
- Reduced memory allocations and copies
- Proper handling of memory growth

## Memory Leak Detection

The library includes tests for detecting memory leaks:

- `MemoryTracker` class monitors memory usage during operations
- Tests verify that memory usage doesn't grow excessively
- Buffer pooling statistics help identify inefficient memory usage

## Performance Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks are included to measure the impact of optimizations:

- Encoding benchmarks for various data types
- Decoding benchmarks for various data types
- Round-trip benchmarks for common operations
- Comparison of pooled vs. non-pooled operations

## Best Practices

To get the best performance and memory efficiency:

1. Reuse encoder and decoder instances when possible
2. Always call `cleanup()` when done with an encoder or decoder
3. Use appropriate buffer sizes to minimize reallocations
4. For high-performance applications, consider pre-allocating buffers
5. Monitor memory usage and pool statistics in production

## Configuration

The buffer pool can be configured to match your application's needs:

```typescript
const pool = BufferPool.getInstance();
pool.configure(32, 2048); // 32 buffers, 2KB default capacity
```

## Statistics

You can monitor buffer pool efficiency using the statistics API:

```typescript
const stats = BufferPool.getInstance().getStats();
console.log(`Reuse ratio: ${stats.getReuseRatio() * 100}%`);
console.log(`Pool utilization: ${stats.getUtilization()}%`);
```

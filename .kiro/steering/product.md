# MessagePack AssemblyScript Library

This project is a MessagePack serialization library implemented in AssemblyScript. MessagePack is a binary serialization format that's more efficient than JSON, allowing for smaller data sizes and faster parsing.

## Purpose

The library provides efficient encoding and decoding of data between AssemblyScript types and MessagePack binary format. It's designed to be used in WebAssembly environments where performance and small binary size are important.

## Key Features

- Binary serialization with MessagePack format
- Optimized for WebAssembly environments
- Type-safe encoding and decoding
- Support for all MessagePack data types
- Efficient buffer management
- Comprehensive test suite

## Current Status

The library is under active development. The encoder currently supports basic types (null, boolean, integers) with more complex types planned for implementation. The decoder is in early development stages.

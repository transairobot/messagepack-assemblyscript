# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds class serialization and deserialization capabilities to the MessagePack AssemblyScript library. Since AssemblyScript doesn't have reflection, users will provide explicit field definitions and type information to enable automatic serialization of class instances to MessagePack format and deserialization back to class instances.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want to serialize class instances to MessagePack format, so that I can efficiently store and transmit complex object data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user defines a class with serializable fields THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to register field names and types
2. WHEN a user calls serialize on a class instance THEN the system SHALL encode the instance as a MessagePack map with field names as keys
3. WHEN serializing a class instance THEN the system SHALL only include fields that have been explicitly registered for serialization
4. WHEN serializing nested class instances THEN the system SHALL recursively serialize nested objects that are also registered for serialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want to deserialize MessagePack data back into class instances, so that I can reconstruct my original objects from binary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides MessagePack binary data and a target class type THEN the system SHALL deserialize the data into a new instance of that class
2. WHEN deserializing MessagePack map data THEN the system SHALL map field names to the corresponding class properties based on registered field definitions
3. WHEN deserializing nested objects THEN the system SHALL recursively deserialize nested maps into their corresponding registered class types
4. WHEN encountering missing fields during deserialization THEN the system SHALL use default values or leave fields uninitialized as appropriate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want to define field metadata for my classes, so that the serialization system knows which fields to serialize and their types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to make a class serializable THEN the system SHALL provide a way to register field names and their corresponding types
2. WHEN registering field metadata THEN the system SHALL support all basic MessagePack types (null, boolean, integers, floats, strings, arrays, maps)
3. WHEN registering field metadata THEN the system SHALL support nested class types that are also registered for serialization
4. WHEN field metadata is registered THEN the system SHALL validate that the field exists on the class and the type information is correct

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want type-safe serialization and deserialization, so that I can catch type mismatches at compile time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using serialization methods THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time type checking for registered classes
2. WHEN deserializing data THEN the system SHALL validate that the MessagePack data structure matches the expected class schema
3. WHEN type mismatches occur during deserialization THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive error messages
4. WHEN serializing unregistered classes THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time errors indicating the class needs registration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want efficient serialization performance, so that class serialization doesn't significantly impact my application's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing class instances THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations and copies
2. WHEN deserializing class instances THEN the system SHALL reuse existing buffer reading mechanisms from the core library
3. WHEN processing large numbers of objects THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance characteristics
4. WHEN serializing nested objects THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary recursive calls that could cause stack overflow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack AssemblyScript library, I want clear error handling for serialization failures, so that I can debug issues with my class definitions and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serialization fails due to invalid field types THEN the system SHALL throw an error with the specific field name and expected type
2. WHEN deserialization fails due to missing required fields THEN the system SHALL throw an error indicating which fields are missing
3. WHEN deserialization fails due to type mismatches THEN the system SHALL throw an error with the field name and type mismatch details
4. WHEN attempting to serialize unregistered classes THEN the system SHALL throw an error indicating the class needs to be registered first

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the buffer pool optimization system from the MessagePack AssemblyScript library. The buffer pool was originally implemented to optimize memory usage by reusing buffer instances, but it adds complexity to the codebase and may not provide significant benefits in all use cases. Removing it will simplify the code architecture and reduce maintenance overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the MessagePack library, I want a simplified codebase without buffer pooling complexity, so that the library is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the buffer pool classes are removed THEN the library SHALL still function correctly for all encoding and decoding operations
2. WHEN buffer pool imports are removed THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN the buffer pool logic is eliminated THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged for core functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the encoder and decoder to use direct buffer allocation, so that the memory management is straightforward and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encoding operations occur THEN the encoder SHALL create GrowableBuffer instances directly without pooling
2. WHEN decoding operations occur THEN the decoder SHALL use BufferReader directly without pooled buffer readers
3. WHEN buffer operations complete THEN memory SHALL be managed by the WebAssembly garbage collector without manual pooling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all buffer pool related code removed from the codebase, so that there are no unused or dead code paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the buffer-pool.ts file SHALL be deleted
2. WHEN buffer pool imports are removed THEN no references to BufferPool, BufferPoolStats, or PooledBufferReader SHALL exist in the codebase
3. WHEN the public API is updated THEN buffer pool exports SHALL be removed from index.ts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to continue passing after buffer pool removal, so that I can be confident the library functionality is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buffer pool tests are removed THEN the remaining test suite SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN buffer pool logic is eliminated THEN all integration tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN round-trip tests SHALL verify data integrity is maintained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the encoder and decoder constructors simplified, so that the pooling configuration options are no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the encoder constructor is updated THEN the usePooling parameter SHALL be removed
2. WHEN the decoder constructor is updated THEN the usePooling parameter SHALL be removed
3. WHEN pooling options are removed THEN the constructors SHALL maintain backward compatibility for other parameters

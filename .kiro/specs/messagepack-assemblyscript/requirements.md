# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a MessagePack serialization library implemented in AssemblyScript. MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format that's more compact than JSON while maintaining cross-platform compatibility. The library will provide encoding and decoding capabilities for various data types, with AssemblyScript as the only dependency to ensure minimal overhead and WebAssembly compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using AssemblyScript, I want to serialize basic data types to MessagePack format, so that I can efficiently store and transmit data in a compact binary format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call encode with a boolean value THEN the system SHALL return a MessagePack encoded byte array with the correct boolean format
2. WHEN I call encode with an integer (i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64) THEN the system SHALL return a MessagePack encoded byte array using the most compact integer representation
3. WHEN I call encode with a floating point number (f32, f64) THEN the system SHALL return a MessagePack encoded byte array with the correct float format
4. WHEN I call encode with a null value THEN the system SHALL return a MessagePack encoded byte array with the null format (0xc0)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serialize string data to MessagePack format, so that I can handle text data efficiently in binary format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call encode with a string of length 0-31 THEN the system SHALL use fixstr format (0xa0-0xbf)
2. WHEN I call encode with a string of length 32-255 THEN the system SHALL use str8 format (0xd9)
3. WHEN I call encode with a string of length 256-65535 THEN the system SHALL use str16 format (0xda)
4. WHEN I call encode with a string of length 65536+ THEN the system SHALL use str32 format (0xdb)
5. WHEN encoding strings THEN the system SHALL use UTF-8 encoding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serialize array data to MessagePack format, so that I can handle collections of data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call encode with an array of length 0-15 THEN the system SHALL use fixarray format (0x90-0x9f)
2. WHEN I call encode with an array of length 16-65535 THEN the system SHALL use array16 format (0xdc)
3. WHEN I call encode with an array of length 65536+ THEN the system SHALL use array32 format (0xdd)
4. WHEN encoding arrays THEN the system SHALL recursively encode each element according to its type
5. WHEN encoding arrays THEN the system SHALL maintain element order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serialize map/object data to MessagePack format, so that I can handle key-value pairs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call encode with a map of size 0-15 THEN the system SHALL use fixmap format (0x80-0x8f)
2. WHEN I call encode with a map of size 16-65535 THEN the system SHALL use map16 format (0xde)
3. WHEN I call encode with a map of size 65536+ THEN the system SHALL use map32 format (0xdf)
4. WHEN encoding maps THEN the system SHALL encode keys and values according to their respective types
5. WHEN encoding maps THEN the system SHALL support string keys

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deserialize MessagePack data back to AssemblyScript types, so that I can reconstruct the original data from binary format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call decode with valid MessagePack bytes THEN the system SHALL return the correct AssemblyScript value
2. WHEN I call decode with invalid MessagePack bytes THEN the system SHALL throw an appropriate error
3. WHEN decoding THEN the system SHALL handle all supported MessagePack format types correctly
4. WHEN decoding arrays THEN the system SHALL recursively decode all elements
5. WHEN decoding maps THEN the system SHALL reconstruct key-value pairs correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle binary data in MessagePack format, so that I can serialize raw byte arrays efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call encode with binary data of length 0-255 THEN the system SHALL use bin8 format (0xc4)
2. WHEN I call encode with binary data of length 256-65535 THEN the system SHALL use bin16 format (0xc5)
3. WHEN I call encode with binary data of length 65536+ THEN the system SHALL use bin32 format (0xc6)
4. WHEN decoding binary data THEN the system SHALL return the original byte array

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and type-safe API, so that I can use the library easily and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide strongly typed encode/decode functions
2. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL export clear public interfaces
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL follow AssemblyScript best practices
5. WHEN building the library THEN the system SHALL only depend on AssemblyScript standard library

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to be memory efficient, so that it performs well in WebAssembly environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encoding data THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations
2. WHEN decoding data THEN the system SHALL reuse buffers where possible
3. WHEN processing large data THEN the system SHALL not cause memory leaks
4. WHEN compiled to WebAssembly THEN the system SHALL have minimal binary size overhead
